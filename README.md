## A General-Purpose Maybe Type for C

Represent missing values explicitly without `NULL` or *sentinel values*.

![][EXAMPLE]

> [!NOTE]
> [SchrÃ¶dinger's cat][SCHRODINGERS_CAT] is inside a box. Until you look, you don't know if it's *alive* or *dead*. A
> [Maybe type][MAYBE_TYPE] works the same way. It either contains a cat, meaning you have a value, or it's empty,
> meaning you have nothing. Instead of risking errors when there's no cat, **Optional** makes you handle both cases
> explicitly, eliminating the need for [null checks][NULL_CHECKING] or [sentinel values][SENTINEL_VALUE].
